**Objective:** Build a modern, responsive website using a modular design architecture that prioritizes scalability, functionality, and ease of maintenance.  

 **Design Requirements:**
 - Use a **component-based structure** (e.g., React, Vue, or Web Components) to isolate UI logic and promote reusability.
 - Organize code using **feature-based folders** or **atomic design principles** (atoms, molecules, organisms).
 - Ensure **separation of concerns** between layout, logic, and styling.
 - Implement **responsive design** using mobile-first principles and utility-first CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS).
 - Use **semantic HTML** and accessible ARIA roles to support screen readers and SEO.

 **Scalability & Maintainability:**
 - Use **environment-based configuration** (e.g., `.env` files) for deployment flexibility.
 - Integrate **routing and state management** using scalable patterns (e.g., React Router, Redux Toolkit, or Zustand).
 - Apply **lazy loading** and **code splitting** to optimize performance.
 - Use **version control-friendly file structure** and consistent naming conventions.
 - Include **unit and integration tests** using tools like Jest, Vitest, or Cypress.

 **Best Coding Practices:**
 - Follow **DRY**, **KISS**, and **SOLID** principles.
 - Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code consistency.
 - Document components and logic with clear comments and optionally JSDoc.
 - Prefer **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience.
 - Avoid hardcoding values; use constants and config files.

 **Optional Enhancements:**
 - Add **CI/CD pipeline hooks** for automated testing and deployment.
 - Integrate **analytics and error tracking** (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry).
 - Use **headless CMS** or API-first backend for content flexibility.
 - Consider **internationalization (i18n)** support if targeting multiple regions.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons, but you are able to use other tools as you see fit
